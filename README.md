# Chatbot GPT

This a simple chatbot example using the GPT-4o-model model from OpenAI. The chatbot is divided into two parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is a simple Astro app that uses the backend to generate responses to user messages. The backend is a REST API that uses the GPT-40 mini model to generate responses to user messages.

The README is divided into two parts: the frontend and the backend. Each part has its own instructions on how to run the project.
